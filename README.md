# CS Air 
## Flight terminal simulation

This was written for my Programming Studio class, where the emphasis is how to
become a better programmer. As such, they stressed writing unit-tests, writing
readable, maintainable, modular code, etc. Hopefully some of those practices
will shine through.

### How to execute
I used IntelliJ's Rubymine to build and execute this.

#### For anyone who has yet to take the class
Please don't copy that'd just be a pain for you and me. Ty <3
